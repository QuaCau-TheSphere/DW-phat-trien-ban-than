#### Welcome to the MindSkills Playbook: How to Ace the Game of Life  
  
##### **”What is this? The last thing I need is another self-improvement book.“**  
  
Self-improvement books don’t work as well as you hope because they aren’t personalized enough. Also, they only have a “piece of the elephant,” such as habits, mindset, positivity, mental models, winning friends and influencing people, building self-esteem, productivity, etc. etc. etc. They can be valuable for specific issues, but you need a system.  
  
You need your own personal path, which my hyperlinked approach provides. MindSkills is the most comprehensive system of personal development. But you can learn it in the bits and pieces you need most right now. It’s not linear because life is not linear.  
  
> If you’re still skeptical about why you need a better strategy for personal development than reading the self-help books, read this:    
> [Why you need a better personal development strategy](https://publish.obsidian.md/mindskills-playbook/_MindSkills+Playbook/Why+you+need+a+better+personal+development+strategy)    
> [To improve yourself, the first thing to improve is your self-improvement strategy](https://publish.obsidian.md/mindskills-playbook/_MindSkills+Playbook/To+improve+yourself%2C+the+first+thing+to+improve+is+your+self-improvement+strategy)  
  
##### How?  
  
Highly effective people use a simple set of techniques to be successful and happy.  
  
They all come down to a few things that you can learn easily if you know where to start and how to find the right sequence to learn them in **_for you_**.  
  
So, your choice: You can read 50 wonderful and useful self-improvement books for a decade or two, always hoping that the next one will “do it.” Or, you can use my lifetime experience to help you figure out what will have the most impact on your life NOW.  
  
##### Who the hell are you?  
  
This is not the place to impress you with my credentials. You can read my bio [elsewhere](https://publish.obsidian.md/mindskills-playbook/_MindSkills+Playbook/Who+is+George+Silverman%3F).  
  
What's relevant here: I’m 80 years old. I've studied the world's most effective people, had some amazing mentors, put their methods into practice myself with great success, and taught them to others. This is my attempt to give back before I leave the planet.  
  
**These methods work.** Not just for me. They are adaptable to who you are and to developing who you want to become, not who someone else thinks you should be. They will make you more you and give you the confidence to put it out there.  
  
Most people (you?) were taught how to live by unhappy, unsuccessful parents and teachers. No wonder the world is a mess. The same crap gets handed down from generation to generation!  
  
This is the place to begin your exploration and adventure, with an open, curious mind. Dip in. Try stuff. Unlearn what you were taught. Ask me questions on Twitter @GeorgeSilverman.  
  
Also, If you have a suggestion, please let me know, by DMing me on Twitter @GeorgeSilverman. I'm exploring a better mechanism where people can contribute to the Playbook. If you have any suggestions for how to do that, please let me know. I’m hoping that the Obsidian @obsdmd publishing platform that you’re on now will build in this feature.  
  
Come to my Twitter Spaces to discuss these methods.  
  
#### How to Read this book  
  
Unlike other books, this is a “living book”: It is made up mostly of independent essays, intended to be read in a sequence you choose, guided by your curiosity and interest. Check the table of contents and, eventually, the hub pages, and see what “strikes your fancy.” That's your subconscious telling you that you are receptive to and will benefit from reading it. Jump around. Life's an adventure.  
  
Here's what I'll teach you in this Playbook:  
  
The Silverman Method for getting what you want, The Basic Flow:  
  
1. Gather Info  
2. Evaluate  
3. Set Goals  
4. Problem-Solve  
5. Decide  
6. Plan  
7. Implement  
  
All of these basic steps are enabled by the basic MindSkills, some of which are:  
  
Going Meta    
Super Learning    
Critical thinking    
Creativity
